# Group Project Proposal 
By: Jackie Chen, Kayla Doan, Quang Nguyen, Kaiden Ong, Ryan Nguyen

# Project Description

## Who is our target audidence?
Our target audience is indecisive individuals who want to socialize over food but cannot get an idea of their wants. I envision college students bringing up this website before going out and making a choice quickly to limit the time planning and focus on the time together.

## Why does your audience want to use your application? Please provide some sort of reasoning. 
Our audience wants to use our application because it allows them to save time and make choices for them. It also allows people to have better communication between users and make everyoneâ€™s choices and opinions heard.

## Why do you as developers want to build this application?
As people who love eating and trying out new places, it can be incredibly difficult to all agree on a location. Thus we wish there was a web app that made it easy and enjoyable to find a spot that the whole group agrees on. So logically it made sense for us to create this web app. As developers this app drew us in because while not extremely difficult, it still provides great opportunities to apply everything we learned in this class to an app we will actually use.

# Technical Description

We will use rest API to take user input as well as mongodb as the database to store user and restaurant information.
